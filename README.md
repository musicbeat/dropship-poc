AWS-S3-Lambda-Dynamodb-SNS

This is a simple POC for use in a brown-bag style demo. It is an exploration of integrations of AWS services using:
* S3 events
* Lambda functions (in JavaScript on node.js)
* IAM (of course)
* DynamoDB
* SNS

Nothing here is original. The ideas mostly come from https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/walkthroughs.html 
and http://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/best-practices-dynamic-data-ingestion-with-s3-and-lambda or from heavy 
use of google.

Nothing here should be used as is in any kind of production application.
